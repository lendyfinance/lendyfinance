### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Lendy Finance is a decentralized and incentivized platform which enables anyone to seamlessly lend and borrow crypto assets.

At the opposite of the majority of lending platforms, Lendy Finance works in a P2P kind of way, which means that the loans, and hence the earnings, are not pooled. Every lender can choose the terms of his loan and find a borrower who accepts them. This approach enables lenders to have more predictability (as the interest rates are guaranteed), and hence to make better decisions. Indeed, traditional pooled lending platforms will usually have huge APY variation, which can lead to lenders loosing money on gas because the 15% APY announced lasted for 24 hours only. The only downside of individualized loans is that it requires lenders to be more active (i.e. renew their loans every time they get repaid), but we will implement an automated lending feature where they can choose their terms and let their funds work for them.

Another huge difference between our project and the competition is that Lendy Finance will not only reward lenders with fixed and predictable interest rates, but also (and most importantly) the borrowers. Indeed, to attract more borrowers and solve the issue of the lack of borrowers discussed above, every borrower who repays his loan will receive LDY tokens as an incentive. The amount of LDY earned will depend on the interest rates paid and the detailed calculation will be release later.

Lendy will look a bit like Twino or Peerberry, but with crypto instead of fiat currencies, and in a decentralized infrastructure.
